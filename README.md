# Decentralised_VotingSystem

I've been working on a decentralized application, or dApp, on the Ethereum blockchain. I formulated an Ethereum smart contract,using which we can hold an election between two candidates.I've written tests against the smart contract, deployed it to the Ethereum blockchain, and developed a client-side application that allows accounts to cast votes.

Normally when you interact with a web application, you use a web browser to connect to a central server over a network.

If we were to build our voting application on the web, we’d run into a few problems:

1--The data on the database could be changed: it could be counted more than once, or removed entirely. 2--The source code on the web server could also be changed at any time.

We don’t want to build our app on the web. We want to build it on the blockchain where anyone connected to the network can participate in the election. Instead of having a network, a central server, and a database, the blockchain is a network and a database all in one.
